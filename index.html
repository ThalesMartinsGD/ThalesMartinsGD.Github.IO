        <p>
            The first game I ever beat was The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I was maybe 3 or 4 at the time, messing around with my mother’s N64, trying to figure out how I get from Kakariko village at the start of the game to Death Mountain which I had seen
            on a another save. Since I couldn’t read at the time, much less in English, I asked my mom for help translating what people were saying. We ended up playing through the entire game together from start to finish, me on the controller, her with
            a guide on hand, telling me how to get the Biggoron’s sword or trying to coach me through the forest dungeon which absolutely terrified little me with its ghosts and creepy ceiling hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact a lot of the time I spent with my family when I was younger was centered around various media. Every week we would rent several movies at a nearby blockbuster and watch them together and I’d spend many a summer with my cousins trying to beat a
            new game. It’s only natural I grew up so fascinated with storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’d spend many a sleepless hours lying in bed thinking about games. How and why they worked, what I was going to do next, mulling over what I liked or not and why. I wanted to play all of them, see all there was to see, have every new experience I could.
        </p>
        <p>
            That time I spent with my mother playing Zelda was probably my most cherished memory. Looking back, its likely the reason I would inevitably gravitate towards game dev. I want to be able to create those experiences for other people, to share with them
            at least a little of something of what was so special to me.

                            <p>
                                From Zero is a 3d Dungeon Crawler with life-sim elements where you get to play through your own superhero origin story and juggle your commitments as a hero with your daily life as a foreign exchange student to a small American town. It was developed
                                during the 4th semester at the UE/IADE Games and Apps development course in a “cross” semester with the help of the Global Design course who contributed to the art.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Inspired by a wide array of media including comic books, tv shows and sitcoms, the aim of the project is to give players an opportunity to roleplay as the type of superhero they want to be as well as to experience firsthand classic scenarios from media
                                like performing at a talent show, going trick or treating during Halloween or having to bail from a social situation to deal with an extradimensional threat to our world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While there are quite a few fantastic superhero games out there very few of them lean into a roleplaying or day-to-day angle. Spider-Man mostly does Spider-Man things (Black Suit options in Web of shadows notwithstanding), as a player you don’t really
                                have control over how or why he approaches a situation the way he does. From Zero aimed to fill that niche. Want to use your powers to cheat at your tests? Sure. Want to avoid getting involved in general super heroics to
                                protect your identity? Why not?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The game is broken down into 2 overall segments: The dungeons (which exist in another dimension encroaching on ours) and the overworld/town. The dungeons have randomly generated layouts where you must manage your health and energy to progress, with 3d
                                action combat that includes air combos and special abilities. This aspect of the game was spearheaded by my classmate (at the time) and good friend (currently) Pedro Santos who has a passion for action design and even impressively
                                got the boss up and running in less than a day through clever reuse of assets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Back in town, the aspect I was directly responsible for besides the overall direction, players must manage their time, which is broken into 3 segments (morning, afternoon, night) between going to school, hanging out with friends, dealing with special
                                events (such as holidays or scripted attacks on the town) and going into the other dimension to stop them before its too late. One segment feeds into the other – joining a tabletop game group might give you better ideas
                                on how to explore the other world or spending time training with your AI companion might unlock new functionalities that help you be more efficient with your time.

                        <div id="zeroDesign" class="tabcontent zero">
                            <p>
                                The entire idea of the game dates back close to a decade ago when I first read the Ultimate Spider-Man line of comics which focus on a younger Peter Parker who is still in high-school. Coupled with that was a fascination with Americana. I was born in
                                Brazil, and although I studied for 6 years in an international school in Sao Paulo where most of my teachers where American, my main exposure to American culture was still media such as movies and books. Together these
                                two things added up to the key experience we wanted to cultivate for the game: what it’s like to be a full-time student and part-time hero in a heightened, idealized version of a small American town from varied media.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An obvious font of inspiration was the Persona series, by Atlus, which capture a similar experience although focused on Japanese culture and uses typically Anime tropes. Besides the focus on America, there were two other key divergences: first, the gameplay
                                which both for thematic reasons and personal preference was changed to something closer to action adventure combat. It doesn’t make much sense to make a love letter to Americana but use a traditionally Japanese form of
                                gameplay. Second, player expression through choices and customization was one of the core pillars of the design, whereas Persona follows a less variable structure. Its important that players got to tell their own story
                                and build their own path, we want it to be their story as much as ours. In practice there wasn’t enough time to meaningfully incorporate different story paths but the framework to do so is largely there.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From there the overall structure of the game was established. Managing all your newfound responsibilities are a core part of this type of superhero story so naturally a time management aspect would be necessary. To avoid the complications that come from
                                a “real-time” day-night cycle an event based time progression was chosen. This allowed for a more static overworld where characters being in the same spot would be easier to accept as well as freed up time that would be
                                necessary to setup convincing enough NPC behavior. Not to mention the much more sophisticated level design necessary to make the city fun to traverse or the more complicated overall game structure that would be needed.
                                A single time chunk would either be what we called an “automatic event” that triggered at certain times of day/days of the month (such as going to school on a Monday morning) or a free time slot where the player could choose
                                what to do with their time, mainly developing their relationships with other characters which would unlock additional abilities and features (for example, training with your hero friends would unlock a dodge roll).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Keeping the setup of the game plausible took some time. If we had monsters attacking the town every other week it would stand to reason that the government would eventually intercede, and daily life would change irrevocably. If we wanted levels to be
                                replayable it wouldn’t make sense for enemies to still be in the same place a month later and having believable spaces in town as combat environments would lead to a lot of level design overhead. Eventually we got to the
                                other dimension angle which neatly sidestepped most of these issues and saved combat events in the “real” world for special occasions. Dungeons would represent threats from the other dimension that needed to be dealt with
                                before they could spill over to our world. Since going into the dungeon would take up free time slots, efficient play would be extrinsically encouraged – the less trips it takes to deal with a dungeon, the more free time
                                you have for other activities which then feed back into your abilities. To that end, it was necessary to create attrition for the player while exploring. Healing could be done by expending a finite amount of energy which,
                                when gone, would prevent the use of special abilities and further healing. The better you play, the less you heal, the farther you can get in one run. If the player ran out of health, they would be transported back to our
                                world and need to use another timeslot to try again. For the vertical slice its possible to regain health and energy by breaking boxes in the dungeon but this would be considerably nerfed otherwise.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As previously mentioned, when in town it’s possible to develop relationships with archetypal characters (such as the Jock, the Queen Bee, etc.) as well as participate in activities like joining the football team or a tabletop group. These are progressed
                                through a tiered approval system, reach enough approval to get to the next tier and you get a unique event and possibly a bonus. Approval can be earned by picking certain dialog options both in relationship events as well
                                as in automatic events. Furthermore, by spending a free time slot interacting with these relationships between tiers its possible to get a fixed amount of approval.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The thematic through line for the game’s story and character interactions would be the relationship between power and freedom. The more power you have, be it personal strength or the amount of money in your wallet, the more you can do for yourself. On
                                the flipside of the coin however the more you could do for others (with great power comes great responsibility and all that). Every relationship would aim to circle back to this theme on differing ends of the spectrum and
                                through interacting with them the player could establish their own ethos. For example, the character Sam, your classmate who also has powers and has been mentoring you, feels that she has a greater responsibility to the
                                world since you two are ostensibly the only ones who can deal with the larger threat. Therefore she’s willing to not intervene in more mundane issues in order to keep a low profile and not risk her life needlessly. As the
                                player you can agree with her outlook or disagree and help people if you can.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the source of our protagonists powers we went with an advanced AI - Nano suit combo who can adapt and grow but can’t be decoupled from its host. The reasoning for this was fivefold: first, it could easily and sensibly fit into our overall concept
                                for character progression. Second, it’d be a reproduceable phenomenon, which meant we could rope more characters in organically into the action yet an outside agent wouldn’t be able to just take over the mantle without
                                issue. Third, having a supercomputer in your brain is a widely applicable powerset which we could leverage for interesting situations such as referring to it for answers on a test. Fourth, it gave us a character that could
                                easily be used to tutorialize concepts and nudge the player as needed. Fifth, it gives a diegetic way to include elements like the UI into the game’s fiction. Plus, for a bonus sixth reason, I just really like the aesthetic.

                                The biggest issue with the overall design is that the relationship between the dungeon and the overworld is mostly one way, a lot of what you do in town aids your dungeoneering but the dungeon itself mostly affects the town as a time limit and a use for
                                a free time slot. The limited timeframe to design and implement everything also meant other things had to be left on the cutting room floor, including an opening segment to the game with simplified character creation. The
                                playable build therefore starts with an automatic event to give context and a small combat encounter before settling into what would be the bulk of the game – Free time with some automatic events peppered throughout. Still,
                                given the circumstances I’m proud of what we managed to accomplish.

                                    We went wild with the scope. My group partner and I had already discussed the project the semester before as it was something I’ve been thinking about for a long time, and we were both really excited to work on it. Even our professors and guests from
                                    the local Portuguese game dev scene thought it was too much for the time we had. We took that as a challenge. It meant a lot of work and neither of us wanted to settle for less so we did our best to add everything we
                                    could. Overall, it was worth it. We got a perfect grade on our last delivery and both of us had created something we were really proud of. It did lead to some minor issues – although we had managed to add everything
                                    we wanted feature-wise, we had comparatively little content. One Dungeon with a boss, a handful of events, and only couple characters to interact with. In the end it’s more a vertical slice than a full game, but I’m
                                    happy with what we accomplished given our resources and strict time limit.

                                    It was the first time the artists on our team ever worked on a game and their course had different grading priorities than ours. It was a bit of a struggle to build a common vocabulary and to prioritize the project versus their (and our) other classes
                                    and assignments that would also take the game into account. Notably, it was tricky to deal with ingrained conventions such as health being red and energy being blue when sometimes their art had them the other way around
                                    (which inevitably confused our play testers). We eventually settled into a good working rhythm and managed to overcome enough of our communication issues to get a lot of work done. We even kept in touch afterwards.

                                Neon Pulse is a top-down 2d competitive multiplayer game. Developed during the first semester of the GAD course, Neon Pulse was the first game I ever worked on. My team member Raul Grell was already at the time a very skilled programmer (In Portugal,
                                unlike Brazil, programming can be taught in high school as a part of the normal curriculum and Raul had also worked as a programmer for several years before applying to college) so I took over the documentation and design
                                side of the project while he would focus more on the implementation, although there was, of course, some overlap.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The main source of inspiration for the game was the wonderful Dota 2 mod “Hardcore Ninja” which uses Dota 2 to create a fast-paced game centered around landing skill shots and mind games focused on psyching others out and causing them to waste their defensive
                                options. Neon Pulse aimed to adapt hardcore ninja to a direct style of control but maintain the same core design principles.

                                At the end of the day the game turned out relatively simple, which normally wouldn’t be included in a “Best of” portfolio, but it represents an important step on my journey as a designer. It was this game that showed me that moving halfway across the
                                world to pursue my passion for games wasn’t such a crazy idea and led to one of the proudest moments in my academic career – when our guest for the semester Edgar Jesus asked us during our first presentation/pitch for the
                                project if we had worked on Game Dev before due to how we presented and structured our ideas. All the time I’d spent obsessing over game design during sleepless nights lying in bed wasn’t for nothing. I’m honestly still
                                kinda riding that high to this day.

                            <p>
                                As we were using a comparatively limited software, Processing, to develop the project and would be learning about game dev as we went it was important to set realistic goals. While online multiplayer would be a can of worms I wouldn’t touch with a 10
                                foot pole at that time and under those conditions (although Raul did manage to prototype online functionality just for fun with astounding ease) local multiplayer was a very enticing option. For one, it meant we could have
                                much reduced scope – we didn’t need any sort of AI or moving parts that weren’t direct results from player input. For another, and perhaps most important, competitive games are basically a shortcut for engagement. If you
                                get 2 or more people together to play, as long as the base game is at least competent, players will naturally compete and banter with each other. Although at the time I had little empiric evidence to back that up this idea
                                was consistently proven true to me when I would participate in local conventions. Our university would display an assortment of projects but the ones people tended to gravitate towards were the competitive ones, inevitably
                                creating impromptu king of the hill tournaments. The fact that people would choose to spend prolonged amounts of time playing Jorge Carvalho’s fantastic Sunset Shockwave when they could be getting previews of big AAA titles
                                speaks to this (and honestly to how good a game Sunset Shockwave is).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since this was my first project and I couldn’t be sure how long something would take to develop we went with a tiered approach – we would start with broadly applicable mechanics that propped up the core design and then add more features and twists on
                                previous mechanics as time permitted. To start we created the base controls and level behavior, such as collision, movement, and one offensive and one defensive option with cooldowns. From there we would explore other features,
                                which surreptitiously worked well in our favor since Raul is very keen on prototyping and testing out new ideas. We toyed around with having different controllable characters (or, in our case, geometric shapes), several
                                different visual effects, creating tools to build levels and different layouts, more complex behavior for our attacks, upgrades throughout the match and a bunch of other things.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the more interesting things we added as work progressed that gave the game more of its own personality was an “action point” system. Instead of traditional cooldowns, each player has a pool of actions that are always recharging, represented by
                                circles orbiting the character. Each point can be used for any action, be it use a pulse to push other players and projectiles away or to use an attack. The intention is to give players higher flexibility and to be easier
                                to tell when someone else has their tools at their disposal or not.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The core rhythm of the game was how the player’s access to his toolset, and his ability to force his opponents to use theirs, dictated the match. My biggest takeaway, however, was this tiered methodology to Game Dev which I applied on every subsequent
                                project I worked on. First I try to start with a solid reusable core that works by itself as a complete, if simple, game loop. From there I branch out and color in the lines as time and technical skill permits.

                                    This was my first game, on my first few months living in a new country, away from family and doing everything on my own for the first time in my life. I didn’t have a computer to get work done on, I was still trying to get all my new documentation in
                                    order (I was a Portuguese citizen by birth but didn’t have a Fiscal Number yet, and other such things), settling into my small home which I shared with three others, getting a bank account, all that good stuff. I love
                                    Portugal but it’s not a very efficient place, all of that took longer than it probably should and took up a lot of my time and mind space.

                                    I had very little (if any) formal training and practice at the time. More so than any other semester, I was very much learning as I went. What is a GDD and how to write one, how game dev is structured, applying programming concepts, who is responsible
                                    for what. It was very much so Game Dev 101. It was here that it became apparent to me how actually working on a game and having a grasp of all these concepts denotes a huge gulf between consumers, critics, and developers.
                                    My devoted and eclectic enjoyment of games was a huge asset for sure, but the basics make all the difference.

                                    Processing is great but it’s definitely limited and very much so a “do it all yourself” kind of software. Making this project in Unity, even with my zero knowledge of Unity at the time, would be considerably easier.

                            <h4>GameJam Game | Unity</h4>
                            <h4>Development time: 2 days | Team size: 3 developers, 1 artist</h4>
                            <p>
                                Fome de Vencer is a top-down Racing game where you must deliver food to different places around the map within a time limit. It was developed during the Games for Good GameJam which is partnered with local charitable organizations who also provide the
                                topics/themes for the games, which in our case was the Banco Alimentar who provide food for the needy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As far as projects go it isn’t particularly impressive but it was a very formative experience for me as a developer so I’d be remiss to not include it. At the time I had never used unity before, so I settled into a more design and leadership-oriented
                                role. Something about trying to make the most of the limited resources and constraints I had really resonated with me - Trying to come up with a feasible design that everyone was interested in working on, working with the
                                artist to figure out how to get the most utility per asset, figuring out the software and getting coached by this brilliant kid who was still in high school so I could do the busywork while they focused on more robust matters.
                                My previous efforts in college had been very positive but this was the first time I had firsthand technical knowledge of how to execute on a game from the ground up before starting the project. It just clicked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’ve had several gamer friends ask me over the year how to get into GameDev. From that day on I always tell them: go to GameJams. Its, by design, GameDev in microcosm. It’s the perfect opportunity to cultivate the mindset you need when developing something.
                                We’ve all had someone with zero development knowledge come up to us and tell us about this app idea they had or their dream open world rpg mmo fps which is like GTA but also *better* which they want you to build. All under
                                their strict supervision, with your acquaintance, such as it is, as the budget. But that’s not what developing a game is. Game Dev is huddling around a blackboard at 3am with your team member that went to get coffee but
                                hasn’t sat back down at his desk yet trying to figure out how in the world you’re going to be able to direct the player to the next checkpoint in a way that works with your intentions for the game experience but is also
                                as easy to build as possible because time is short and we have to work with what we have. Design, and really Game Dev as a whole, is just problem solving, and I was absolutely sure I loved it.

                                After the group formed and we all got acquainted and setup as necessary the first issue to tackle was the theme/topics. They all involved groups that helped society in some way, so it was important to me that we tried to work in that element as much as
                                possible, although in the end I’d say its arguable how well we accomplished that. We went over the type of work all the sponsoring institutions did and concluded that Banco Alimentar was likely the easiest to gamify. We
                                had two broad avenues we could pursue, the preparation and consumption side of it or the delivery side. Both could potentially be interesting but the former would likely require a lot more interlocking systems for a proper
                                game loop, so we went with the latter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our next big consideration was the broad game loop, which was done relatively fast. Going from point A to B and adding a timer is simple, but effective. From there we sketched out the supporting systems we’d need – the movement itself, a guidance system
                                and pickup/drop-off locations, and the map and art.
                                <p>
                                    Movement started out straightforward, we were going top down since it meant we could have simpler assets and skimp out on animation without it seeming out of place. You accelerate, turn, break. Since top down offers such a limited field of view we also
                                    included camera controls so the player could see farther and adjust his path accordingly. Since the player would ostensibly look in the direction he is travelling and 360-degree control might be disorienting we made
                                    it so that the camera can only be moved along the axis the player is facing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A core part of racing games is mastery, either through mechanical execution or through environmental knowledge. The car movement can’t just be functional, it needs to be part of the challenge. This isn’t to say it should be obtuse, but that executing
                                    effectively should be straightforward but with room to improve. Since the map would be informed by our core mechanics, we focused on mastery first. We played around with several ideas but the perspective and the KB+M
                                    default controls limited us somewhat. We landed on a “drift” mechanic where, while holding down a button, the car would spin 360 degrees. When the button is released, the car shoots off in the direction it was facing,
                                    being both a maneuverability tool as well as a speed boost. I was actually quite proud of that. To supplement the driving we needed some way to encourage mastery. Technically, the game being on a timer already did so,
                                    but additional layers that focused on different skills couldn’t hurt.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During each sponsors presentation of who they were and what they did one thing about Banco Alimentar stuck with me: a lot of perfectly good for consumption food gets thrown out due to noticeable, but ultimately harmless, defects. If an apple is bruised,
                                    its likely it won’t get to store shelves. Part of what Banco Alimentar did is redistribute food that would otherwise been thrown away. Now, food is a rather fragile thing to deliver, but in our game you’re doing donuts
                                    and you’re bumbling around all over the place like a cat with a cup stuck to its head. Naturally, bumping around too much would eventually ruin the food, so as an added layer, once you’ve picked up a food package, its
                                    “health” is constantly ticking down (to simulate spoiling) and if you bump into something, it loses a chunk. Don’t make the delivery in time or crash too many times and you lose the delivery and the game. In retrospect,
                                    to serve the game loop better I probably just wouldn’t count it towards total deliveries completed, but for the needy to go hungry because you messed up being a game over fits more in-line with the theme (and was easier
                                    to setup).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Next comes the destinations. We setup static pick up and drop off points around the map that would be randomly paired up for each delivery. To guide the players to their objectives we settled on a compass that always points straight to the destination.
                                    We had been playing around with a waypoint system for other cars on the road to drive along that we could have used to make the arrow always point to the closest waypoint that leads where you want but decided against
                                    it for two reasons. One, it would be more finicky to implement consistently. Two, it limited the opportunity for the player to figure out the best routes and encouraged less interaction with the map.
                                    <p>
                                        Lastly came the map, which worked off a block system, and which I implemented when I wasn’t busy working with the others on the design. If I knew my way around unity at the time, it would have been as easy as making a bunch of prefabs with collision attached
                                        as necessary and placing them. Since I didn’t, instead it was a patchwork of several images which I then manually added collision boxes on top of. Not the cleanest execution, but it got the job done.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Fatigue aside, it was really quite thrilling working on this. I’d usually show up for a few hours whenever there was a GameJam in my university to help with the setup and then talk with people and help them with designing their games. Being there full
                                        time was something else (although I did do the rounds and socialized as much as time allowed). Throughout the years I learned that I excel at joining ideas and tailoring them to the project at hand more than anything
                                        else and this GameJam was essentially just that. The end result might not be much to look at, and we were definitely hampered by time and technical ability, but it was an important step in my Game Design path.
