                            <p>
                                From Zero is a 3d Dungeon Crawler with life-sim elements where you get to play through your own superhero origin story and juggle your commitments as a hero with your daily life as a foreign exchange student to a small American town. It was developed
                                during the 4th semester at the UE/IADE Games and Apps development course in a “cross” semester with the help of the Global Design course who contributed to the art.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Inspired by a wide array of media including comic books, tv shows and sitcoms, the aim of the project is to give players an opportunity to roleplay as the type of superhero they want to be as well as to experience firsthand classic scenarios from media
                                like performing at a talent show, going trick or treating during Halloween or having to bail from a social situation to deal with an extradimensional threat to our world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While there are quite a few fantastic superhero games out there very few of them lean into a roleplaying or day-to-day angle. Spider-Man mostly does Spider-Man things (Black Suit options in Web of shadows notwithstanding), as a player you don’t really
                                have control over how or why he approaches a situation the way he does. From Zero aimed to fill that niche. Want to use your powers to cheat at your tests? Sure. Want to avoid getting involved in general super heroics to
                                protect your identity? Why not?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The game is broken down into 2 overall segments: The dungeons (which exist in another dimension encroaching on ours) and the overworld/town. The dungeons have randomly generated layouts where you must manage your health and energy to progress, with 3d
                                action combat that includes air combos and special abilities. This aspect of the game was spearheaded by my classmate (at the time) and good friend (currently) Pedro Santos who has a passion for action design and even impressively
                                got the boss up and running in less than a day through clever reuse of assets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Back in town, the aspect I was directly responsible for besides the overall direction, players must manage their time, which is broken into 3 segments (morning, afternoon, night) between going to school, hanging out with friends, dealing with special
                                events (such as holidays or scripted attacks on the town) and going into the other dimension to stop them before its too late. One segment feeds into the other – joining a tabletop game group might give you better ideas
                                on how to explore the other world or spending time training with your AI companion might unlock new functionalities that help you be more efficient with your time.

                        <div id="zeroDesign" class="tabcontent zero">
                            <p>
                                The entire idea of the game dates back close to a decade ago when I first read the Ultimate Spider-Man line of comics which focus on a younger Peter Parker who is still in high-school. Coupled with that was a fascination with Americana. I was born in
                                Brazil, and although I studied for 6 years in an international school in Sao Paulo where most of my teachers where American, my main exposure to American culture was still media such as movies and books. Together these
                                two things added up to the key experience we wanted to cultivate for the game: what it’s like to be a full-time student and part-time hero in a heightened, idealized version of a small American town from varied media.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An obvious font of inspiration was the Persona series, by Atlus, which capture a similar experience although focused on Japanese culture and uses typically Anime tropes. Besides the focus on America, there were two other key divergences: first, the gameplay
                                which both for thematic reasons and personal preference was changed to something closer to action adventure combat. It doesn’t make much sense to make a love letter to Americana but use a traditionally Japanese form of
                                gameplay. Second, player expression through choices and customization was one of the core pillars of the design, whereas Persona follows a less variable structure. Its important that players got to tell their own story
                                and build their own path, we want it to be their story as much as ours. In practice there wasn’t enough time to meaningfully incorporate different story paths but the framework to do so is largely there.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From there the overall structure of the game was established. Managing all your newfound responsibilities are a core part of this type of superhero story so naturally a time management aspect would be necessary. To avoid the complications that come from
                                a “real-time” day-night cycle an event based time progression was chosen. This allowed for a more static overworld where characters being in the same spot would be easier to accept as well as freed up time that would be
                                necessary to setup convincing enough NPC behavior. Not to mention the much more sophisticated level design necessary to make the city fun to traverse or the more complicated overall game structure that would be needed.
                                A single time chunk would either be what we called an “automatic event” that triggered at certain times of day/days of the month (such as going to school on a Monday morning) or a free time slot where the player could choose
                                what to do with their time, mainly developing their relationships with other characters which would unlock additional abilities and features (for example, training with your hero friends would unlock a dodge roll).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Keeping the setup of the game plausible took some time. If we had monsters attacking the town every other week it would stand to reason that the government would eventually intercede, and daily life would change irrevocably. If we wanted levels to be
                                replayable it wouldn’t make sense for enemies to still be in the same place a month later and having believable spaces in town as combat environments would lead to a lot of level design overhead. Eventually we got to the
                                other dimension angle which neatly sidestepped most of these issues and saved combat events in the “real” world for special occasions. Dungeons would represent threats from the other dimension that needed to be dealt with
                                before they could spill over to our world. Since going into the dungeon would take up free time slots, efficient play would be extrinsically encouraged – the less trips it takes to deal with a dungeon, the more free time
                                you have for other activities which then feed back into your abilities. To that end, it was necessary to create attrition for the player while exploring. Healing could be done by expending a finite amount of energy which,
                                when gone, would prevent the use of special abilities and further healing. The better you play, the less you heal, the farther you can get in one run. If the player ran out of health, they would be transported back to our
                                world and need to use another timeslot to try again. For the vertical slice its possible to regain health and energy by breaking boxes in the dungeon but this would be considerably nerfed otherwise.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As previously mentioned, when in town it’s possible to develop relationships with archetypal characters (such as the Jock, the Queen Bee, etc.) as well as participate in activities like joining the football team or a tabletop group. These are progressed
                                through a tiered approval system, reach enough approval to get to the next tier and you get a unique event and possibly a bonus. Approval can be earned by picking certain dialog options both in relationship events as well
                                as in automatic events. Furthermore, by spending a free time slot interacting with these relationships between tiers its possible to get a fixed amount of approval.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The thematic through line for the game’s story and character interactions would be the relationship between power and freedom. The more power you have, be it personal strength or the amount of money in your wallet, the more you can do for yourself. On
                                the flipside of the coin however the more you could do for others (with great power comes great responsibility and all that). Every relationship would aim to circle back to this theme on differing ends of the spectrum and
                                through interacting with them the player could establish their own ethos. For example, the character Sam, your classmate who also has powers and has been mentoring you, feels that she has a greater responsibility to the
                                world since you two are ostensibly the only ones who can deal with the larger threat. Therefore she’s willing to not intervene in more mundane issues in order to keep a low profile and not risk her life needlessly. As the
                                player you can agree with her outlook or disagree and help people if you can.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the source of our protagonists powers we went with an advanced AI - Nano suit combo who can adapt and grow but can’t be decoupled from its host. The reasoning for this was fivefold: first, it could easily and sensibly fit into our overall concept
                                for character progression. Second, it’d be a reproduceable phenomenon, which meant we could rope more characters in organically into the action yet an outside agent wouldn’t be able to just take over the mantle without
                                issue. Third, having a supercomputer in your brain is a widely applicable powerset which we could leverage for interesting situations such as referring to it for answers on a test. Fourth, it gave us a character that could
                                easily be used to tutorialize concepts and nudge the player as needed. Fifth, it gives a diegetic way to include elements like the UI into the game’s fiction. Plus, for a bonus sixth reason, I just really like the aesthetic.

                                The biggest issue with the overall design is that the relationship between the dungeon and the overworld is mostly one way, a lot of what you do in town aids your dungeoneering but the dungeon itself mostly affects the town as a time limit and a use for
                                a free time slot. The limited timeframe to design and implement everything also meant other things had to be left on the cutting room floor, including an opening segment to the game with simplified character creation. The
                                playable build therefore starts with an automatic event to give context and a small combat encounter before settling into what would be the bulk of the game – Free time with some automatic events peppered throughout. Still,
                                given the circumstances I’m proud of what we managed to accomplish.

                                    We went wild with the scope. My group partner and I had already discussed the project the semester before as it was something I’ve been thinking about for a long time, and we were both really excited to work on it. Even our professors and guests from
                                    the local Portuguese game dev scene thought it was too much for the time we had. We took that as a challenge. It meant a lot of work and neither of us wanted to settle for less so we did our best to add everything we
                                    could. Overall, it was worth it. We got a perfect grade on our last delivery and both of us had created something we were really proud of. It did lead to some minor issues – although we had managed to add everything
                                    we wanted feature-wise, we had comparatively little content. One Dungeon with a boss, a handful of events, and only couple characters to interact with. In the end it’s more a vertical slice than a full game, but I’m
                                    happy with what we accomplished given our resources and strict time limit.

                                    The artists working with us had little to no knowledge of game dev and their course had different grading priorities than ours. It was a bit of a struggle to build a common vocabulary and to prioritize the project versus their (and our) other classes
                                    and assignments that would also take the game into account. Notably, it was tricky to deal with ingrained conventions such as health being red and energy being blue when sometimes their art had them the other way around
                                    (which inevitably confused our play testers). We eventually settled into a good working rhythm and managed to overcome enough of our communication issues to get a lot of work done. We even kept in touch afterwards,
                                    so we must have done something right!
